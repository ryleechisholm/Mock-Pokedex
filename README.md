# Pokédex Website - Dylan S. Rylee. Michelle.

### What We are Making
 - We are making a dictionary for Pokémon, also known as a Pokédex.
 
### Why We are Making it
 - Pokémon is one of our favorite games, so we want to create a sort of tribute to the game. 
 
### Past Similar Projects
 - Some of year 5 at Base Camp have created similar pokémon projects, so we will use those as reference and try our hardest to create an apt project. 

### Core User Work Flows
 - On the website the user will be able to use a search bar to find pokémon, and a tab where you can create your own pokemon. The pokemon will save to the database. 
 
### Daily Goals
 - The pathing will be done today
 - We hope to get done with the search bars and storing of the data by Wednesday. 
 - And CSS done by Thursday. 
 - And anything else done by Friday. 
 
### Utilize Content
- Forms for pathing and search bar
- Templates for different page layouts
- Store data in models and classes
